Importing your own rapid binary evolution code
================================================

Under Construction


The default rapid binary evolution code is BSE by `Hurley et al. (2002) <http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2002MNRAS.329..897H>`_. We provide python bindings for BSE for integration with dart_board, see the installation guide for instructions.
