Setting up the python API for BSE for use in dart_board

1. Download BSE (not SSE) from Jarrod Hurley’s site (http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~jhurley/bsedload.html) into dart_board/pyBSE/

2. Change directories to dart_board/pyBSE/ with "cd pyBSE". Untar the tarball with “tar -xvf bse.tar”. You should now see a bunch of new files that contains the rapid binary evolution files from SSE/BSE.

3. Move to the parent dart_board directory with "cd ..". Now apply the included BSE patch file using "patch -s -p0 < BSE_updates.patch". This will update all the BSE files.

4. Change directories back to pyBSE with "cd pyBSE". Make the pyBSE executable with “make pybse”.

5. Now, we need to create the pyBSE python library so that it is accessible to any directory. We have included a setup.py script for use with pip. We suggest installing with the command "pip install -e ."
