Setting up the python API for BSE for use in dart_board

1. Download BSE from Jarrod Hurley’s site into dart_board/pyBSE/

2. untar the tarball with “tar -xvf bse.tar”

3. pyBSE already contains the .f files kick.f, evolv2.f, and evolv_wrapper.f, as well as the update make file, Makefile_pyBSE.

4. Replace comenv.f with comenv_pyBSE.f: “cp comenv_pyBSE.f comenv.f”

5. Overwrite the old “Makefile” with “Makefile_pyBSE” using “cp Makefile_pyBSE Makefile”

6. Make pyBSE with “make pybse”
